Design
------

The program has two parts:

* server.py
* client.py

  The server program handles the requests from client program. Client program is a multithreaded program which has a thread dedicated to send creat-time-file-on-server requests over a period of 60 seconds


Dependencies
-------------

None, it should work out of box in python 2.6.x


Usage
------

Run server.py first. Then run client.py and try various commands
